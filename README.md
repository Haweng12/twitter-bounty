# App Version

Flask App

In progress. Add link to heroku app here. 

## How it Works

This app allows anyone to load a dataframe of their followers and DM them within the limits of the Twitter API. All you need are a Twitter account and developer keys and tokens.

## Developer Version - Google Colab

If you are a developer, use this link for a templated guide to gathering followers and sending DM's after sorting. Developers need to ensure they have "Read, write, and Direct Messages" enabled on their app tokens.
