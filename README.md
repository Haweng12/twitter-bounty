## Link to App
[Rabble: A Twitter Application for Mass Messaging your Followers](https://rabble-twitter.herokuapp.com/ "Rabble")


## How it Works

Use this app to sort, gather, and send a message to a database of your Twitter followers.
Sort your follower database with 8 unique parameters. Export your followers to a CSV file. 

### Mass Messaging
Choose how many followers you'd like to reach. Choose a parameter to prioritize them by.
Filter by location if you so choose. Write a message and inform your twitterverse followers. 
Twitter only allows 1000 DM's to be sent per day. With large amounts of followers, this can take a while. 
Feel free to set it and forget it. This app was designed on a timer with Twitter Rate Limits built in.

### Export to CSV
Export your followers from a pre-sorted database to a CSV file.
Load time is approximately 90 seconds per 5000 followers, patience is key!

## User Guidelines

Users need to ensure they have "Read, write, and Direct Messages" enabled on their app tokens.
